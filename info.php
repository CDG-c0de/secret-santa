    Welcome to the secret santa event (with a twist)!<br><br>
    The general concept:<br>
    Before partaking please insert your player into the database with the "add your user" button, use your first name please.<br>
    Every participant buys a few CHEAP and preferably funny/obcure gifts, for a total of no more than 15 euros.<br>
    The admin (I) will assign all the gifts to a "starting pile", in the first phase of the game every player gets to<br>
    pick a gift from the pile one by one. After the pile is empty and the gifts are, if nothing weird happened, evenly<br>
    distributed, the second phase can begin. In the second phase the participants will spin a wheel and get an instruction<br>
    one by one. The instructions involve stealing and giving gifts etc. aka total chaos :D. After approx. 2 hours the game<br>
    ends, and you will be left with the gifts that you have at that moment. If somehow the amount of gifts is significantly<br>
    unbalanced this will be fixed. Gifts do not have to be bought in advance, since Steam does not provide keys.<br>
    You can buy and gift the games to the right person after the event is over, however if you do buy games in advance<br>
    with a key that is always welcome.<br><br>
    Merry Chrysler,<br>
